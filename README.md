# Viper4Android-presets
This repository finds a collection of preset for viper4android 2.7+

Must read

Note : the presets folder is for 2.7.0.5 and below ( if works ) ONLY

Explaination : V4A constantly update and changed how profiles work 2 times, after .0.5 and .1.5.
The developers was provided us a profile converter which could be found in V4A Magisk module. However, I tested myself and the result is 
99% of the profile included in this repo are broken! So I suggest you to downgrade, or make your own preset and commit it here, any commit
are welcome.
